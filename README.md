## BandaidLauncher
A wee little winform app launcher with dependency injecting and savefile redirection.

I made this my junior year of highschool to play Skyrim on the laptops in the digital art classroom. I couldn't install any MSVC dependancies or whatever without admin permissions, so I wrote this app to make executables use various DLLs as specified by a checkbox to get around that. Eventually though I just booted into Linux from a portable SSD

You make little config files for each game, and this tool will sync your savefiles (from the local disk to a flash drive for example...) and launch your game with whatever DLLs you used last time. Good little bit of kit if you're bored
